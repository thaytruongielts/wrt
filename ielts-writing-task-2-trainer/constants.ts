    "ID": 1,
    "Topic": "Giáo dục (Education)",
    "Prompt": "Some people believe that all students should be required to study history and geography at school. Others think that these subjects should be optional. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.",
    "Vietnamese_Translation": "Một số người tin rằng tất cả học sinh nên được yêu cầu học lịch sử và địa lý ở trường. Những người khác nghĩ rằng những môn học này nên là tự chọn. Thảo luận cả hai quan điểm và đưa ra ý kiến của riêng bạn.",
    "Type": "Discuss Both Views & Opinion",
    "Vocabulary": ["mandatory subjects", "core curriculum", "foster a sense of civic responsibility", "cultural literacy", "spatial awareness", "elective courses", "personal aptitude"],
    "Grammar_Structures": ["Not only... but also (Inversion)", "While optional courses allow...", "Requiring these subjects is essential for cultivating... (Gerund)"],
    "Sample_Intro": "It is often debated whether subjects like history and geography should be a <strong>mandatory component</strong> of the school curriculum or <strong>merely elective options</strong>.",
    "Sample_Body1": "On the one hand, proponents argue that making these subjects compulsory is vital as they <strong>foster a sense of civic responsibility</strong> and <strong>cultural literacy</strong> among young people. Specifically, studying the past and the physical world provides students with <strong>a profound understanding</strong> of societal evolution.",
    "Sample_Body2": "Conversely, there is a valid argument that allowing students to choose these subjects, or focus on others, caters better to their <strong>personal aptitude and future career aspirations</strong>, thereby <strong>promoting deeper engagement</strong> and specialisation. Such flexibility may prevent students from being burdened with information.",
    "Sample_Conclusion": "In conclusion, while acknowledging the value of choice, I firmly believe that the long-term benefits of <strong>a shared foundational knowledge</strong> make history and geography <strong>non-negotiable</strong> for all students."

    "Topic": "Môi trường (Environment)",
    "Prompt": "The increase in the production of consumer goods is a major factor in the destruction of the environment. What are the causes of this? What measures can be taken to solve this problem?",
    "Vietnamese_Translation": "Sự gia tăng sản xuất hàng tiêu dùng là một yếu tố chính gây ra sự tàn phá môi trường. Nguyên nhân của việc này là gì? Những biện pháp nào có thể được thực hiện để giải quyết vấn đề này?",
    "Type": "Causes & Solutions",
    "Vocabulary": ["consumerism", "finite resources", "ecological footprint", "unsustainable consumption", "planned obsolescence", "green initiatives", "incentivise sustainability"],
    "Grammar_Structures": ["The main cause stems from...", "If governments were to enforce...", "This problem could be alleviated by... (Passive)"],
    "Sample_Intro": "The escalating production of <strong>consumer goods</strong> is widely regarded as a significant contributor to global <strong>environmental degradation</strong>. This essay will examine the underlying causes of this trend and propose viable solutions.",
    "Sample_Body1": "The primary cause stems from the culture of <strong>unsustainable consumption</strong> and <strong>planned obsolescence</strong>, where products are intentionally designed to have a short lifespan, thereby demanding constant replacement. Furthermore, aggressive marketing campaigns continuously fuel <strong>hedonic consumption</strong>, leading to enormous resource depletion and waste generation.",
    "Sample_Body2": "Effective measures must involve both regulatory and educational approaches; governments should <strong>incentivise sustainable practices</strong> for manufacturers and enforce stricter penalties for environmental breaches. Concurrently, consumers must be educated on the concept of a <strong>circular economy</strong> and reducing their <strong>ecological footprint</strong>.",
    "Sample_Conclusion": "In summary, the destruction linked to rising production is rooted in <strong>consumer culture</strong> and design flaws, which can only be mitigated by a combination of stringent <strong>government regulation</strong> and a radical shift in consumer behaviour."

    "Topic": "Xã hội (Society)",
    "Prompt": "In many countries, the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. Does this trend have more positive or negative effects on society?",
    "Vietnamese_Translation": "Ở nhiều quốc gia, tỷ lệ người lớn tuổi đang tăng đều đặn. Xu hướng này mang lại nhiều tác động tích cực hay tiêu cực hơn đối với xã hội?",
    "Type": "Positive or Negative Development",
    "Vocabulary": ["ageing population", "demographic shift", "strain on public resources", "longevity", "pension deficit", "labour market", "intergenerational knowledge transfer"],
    "Grammar_Structures": ["Not only does this trend pose a challenge, but it also offers opportunities...", "The advantages, such as..., outweigh the disadvantages, which include...", "While the increasing life expectancy is a triumph of medicine..."],
    "Sample_Intro": "The steady rise in the <strong>proportion of older people</strong>, a defining <strong>demographic shift</strong> of our time, presents a complex issue that warrants analysis into its overall societal impact. In my view, the negative effects predominantly outweigh the positive ones.",
    "Sample_Body1": "One major positive is the immense value gained from the experience and wisdom of seniors, often leading to crucial <strong>intergenerational knowledge transfer</strong> in the workplace and community. Moreover, increased <strong>longevity</strong> is fundamentally a triumph of modern public health and living standards, reflecting a successful society.",
    "Sample_Body2": "However, the negatives are highly significant, notably the substantial <strong>strain on public resources</strong> due to soaring healthcare costs and a growing <strong>pension deficit</strong> that must be funded by a shrinking labour force. This imbalance often leads to a heavy <strong>fiscal burden</strong> on the working population.",
    "Sample_Conclusion": "To conclude, despite the valuable contributions of an older generation, the inherent challenges posed by the <strong>ageing population</strong>—primarily the financial and healthcare burdens—suggest that the impact is more negative than positive."
